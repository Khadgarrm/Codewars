/*Boxlines
Given a X*Y*Z box built by arranging 1*1*1 unit boxes, write a function f(X,Y,Z) that returns the number of edges (hence, boxlines) of length 1 (both inside and outside of the box)

Notes
Adjacent unit boxes share the same edges, so a 2*1*1 box will have 20 edges, not 24 edges
X,Y and Z are strictly positive, and can go as large as 2^16 - 1*/


function f(x,y,z){
    return 3*(x*y*z) +2*(x*y+x*z+y*z) + x+y+z;
}
